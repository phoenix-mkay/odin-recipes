        There are all kinds of tasty add-ins to risotto, and mushrooms are just one of them. Mushrooms add an earthy, savory flavor to risotto that makes it a good complement to main dishes like roast chicken, pork, or beef. You can serve mushroom risotto as a side dish, a main dish, or a starter to a multi-course Italian menu.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken broth</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Shallots</li>
        <li>Arborio Rice</li>
        <li>White wine</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Keep the broth hot the whole way through. Measure out a little more into the broth pot than the recipe says to make up for evaporation as it sits.</li>
        <li>An essential step to making risotto is to toast the grains in hot oil until they start to turn translucent around the edges. This could take a couple of minutes. Stir continuously during this process.</li>
        <li>Yes, you stir risotto as it simmers. That's what helps release the starch from the grains of rice to make that creamy texture you want.</li>
        <li>Keep the broth hot and the risotto at a low simmer throughout.</li>
        <li>Risotto is done when the rice is al dente: firm but not crunchy when you bite into it. It should not be as dry as steamed rice, but should have enough liquid to make it loose. Add just a touch more broth if needed before stirring in the butter and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Risotto waits for no one. It will continue to cook as it sits even when it's off the heat, so be prepared to dish it up right away.</li>
    </ol>
